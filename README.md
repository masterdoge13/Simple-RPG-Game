# A Turn-Based RPG Game

## A medieval fantasy game

This is a simple turn-based role playing game. Meant for anyone looking to pass the time with a simple game, this game allows for endless combat and an easy to understand customization and progression system, featuring:

- Equipment with semi-random stats
- Progressively stronger enemies
- Leveling system with customizable base stats

## My interest

I have chosen to create a small game as I aspire to become a game developer. Having played games my entire life, I loved the satisfaction of overcoming challenges that video games provide. One day, I wish to create something that can give that feeling of accomplishment to others and hopefully inspire them to create something great themselves. This project will be a great experience for me to improve as both a programmer and a developer.

## Phase 4: Task 3

If I had more time to refactor and improve my project, I would change the Equipment class to be an abstract class and have different types of equipment extend that class, instead of having the EquipmentType enumeration differentiate between types of equipment. This way, it would be much easier to add other pieces of equipment, like gloves, accessories, or offhand items to the game later. It will make it much easier to separate the different equipment types in the equipped class, instead of having to get and compare the equipment type in each instance of equipment. It would also open the door for unique types of stats on top of the attack multiplier and damage reduction the game currently has.

I would also refactor out an abstract class from Player and Enemy as there is a lot of dupicated code. Fields like attack, current health, max health, difficulty, name, gold, experience, and their getters/setters can be moved to an abstract class. This will allow for much more readable code and possible make it easier to create more enemy types in the future.
