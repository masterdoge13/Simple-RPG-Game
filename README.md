# A Turn-Based RPG Game

## A medieval fantasy game

This is a simple turn-based role playing game. Meant for anyone looking to pass the time with a simple game, this game allows for endless combat and an easy to understand customization and progression system, featuring:

- Equipment with semi-random stats
- Progressively stronger enemies
- Leveling system with customizable base stats

## My interest

I have chosen to create a small game as I aspire to become a game developer. Having played games my entire life, I loved the satisfaction of overcoming challenges that video games provide. One day, I wish to create something that can give that feeling of accomplishment to others and hopefully inspire them to create something great themselves. This project will be a great experience for me to improve as both a programmer and a developer.
